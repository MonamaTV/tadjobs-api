# TadJobs API

Everything in this repo, is our progress so far with building the TadJobs project.

- We are building a Job posting platform that allows users (recruiters and hiring managers) to advertise openings at their companies/organizations. The platform allows recruiter/hiring manager to manage more than one company at a time.

- We are building using Express and Typescript and hosting our database on MongoDB Atlas.

You can build with us by watching the video series on my [YouTube Channel Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDh12_6MPXg&list=PLWAqIssT48AlZE-mD8zl6CGkT4KdQZCF1&ab_channel=Tadnology)
